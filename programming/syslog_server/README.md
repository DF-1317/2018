# syslog_server

This code runs a server in your Java environment. It should work on *nix and Windows systems.
To build this, use the command:
```bash
mvn package
```

## Running
Since you will need the syslog4j package and your program's jar, the <b>run</b> script was included to help
in getting the jar files and executing the test. Any argument you would give the Logger program you can pass in
on the command line like so:
```bash
./run
```
