Welcome to our site. If you are a team member and want to modify anything in
this project, you will need to have some setup done before you can do that.

## One Time Setup
To be able to control who can and who cannot modify this content, we make use
of what is called an ssh key pair. You will need to create this key pair on
your PC. One file is called the private file, that one you will keep close and
secure on your PC. The other file is called the public file; it can be shared
with anyone and will allow a secure recognition of who you are when the need
arrises. The github site, and out projects, are such a user of your public
key file.

Ask your programming coach for more info.
